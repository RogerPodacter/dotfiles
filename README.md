My dotfile setup

Use at your own risk! These work great for me, but I make no guarantees about these working out of the box.

### Overview

Most of this is ganked from the wonderful dotmatrix dotfile setup from the hashrocket guys.
I just wanted any easy way to bootstrap my environment, standardize it accross different machines, and add some
overrides.

The basic idea is you should be able to run `bootstrap.sh` and it will 'just work'.  Since I haven't actually tried
that script against a new machine, I'm not 100% sure that it will, but the bootstrap script is adapted from an existing
script that I used to set up two machines.  My main changes were to make it repeatable (e.g., on a machine that was
already partially set up).
